# SeleniumTest
Repository for my Java/Selenium Project
This project was for a final assignment for a Java/Selenium class that I took at work.

The intent of the project is to run a few tests on a web site that I use frequently.

The user ID and passwords are obviously not real. To run this test, valid credentials need
to be added to the .java file for the web site "MapMyRun.com".  

Testing precontions need to be setup on the web site as well by logging workouts for the test
user account in the current month:
Day 1 = 5 mile run, 28 minute duration, 500 calories burned
Day 2 = 3 mile run, 23 minute duration, 300 calories burned
Day 3 = 5 mile run, 40 minute duration, 500 calories burned
Day 4 = 13.1 mile run, 2h:1m:1s minute duration, 1310 calories burned
