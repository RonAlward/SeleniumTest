# SeleniumTest
Repository for my Java/Selenium Project
This project was for a final assignment for a Java/Selenium class that I took at work.
The intent of the project is to run a few tests on a web site that I use frequently.
The user ID and passwords are obviously not real. To run this test, valid credentials need
to be added to the .java file and the testing precontions need to be setup on the web site.
